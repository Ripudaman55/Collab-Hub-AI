Scenario: ${scenario}
Preferred Agent: ${agent}
Difficulty: ${difficulty}

Based on the scenario, suggest:
1. The most suitable AI tool or model (including non-OpenAI options if relevant)
2. A structured prompt using either ICE (Instruction, Context, Example) or RCR (Role, Constraint, Result) depending on the context.
3. Ensure prompt is clear, well-formatted, and directly usable for generative AI.
4. Avoid generic or vague suggestions.

Take reference from the following for sugesting prompts you may use them depending on the scenario:
          🔹 Beginner Level Prompt:
            Summarize what we need: Summarize the methodology of a given AI research paper in simple terms.
            What specifics: Limit to 3–4 sentences, non-technical, for third-year undergrads.
            Avoids: Overuse of academic terms, citations, or deep technical analysis.
            Results be like: “The researchers collected health data, trained an AI model, and tested it on patient records.”
            Citation: Input paper from Google Scholar or Dimensions.ai.
            Reason: Builds student understanding of research structure.

            🔹 Intermediate Level Prompt:
            Summarize what we need: Write a mini literature review (300 words) on AI in smart cities using 3 peer-reviewed sources.
            What specifics: Use citation, thematic grouping, and include gap identification.
            Avoids: Copy-pasting abstracts, single-source summaries.
            Results be like: A properly structured mini-review with synthesis.
            Citation: From Dimensions.ai, filtered for 2020–2024.
            Reason: Develops analytical skills and source comparison abilities.

            🔹 Advanced Level Prompt:
            Summarize what we need: Identify a research gap in a field (e.g., AI in agriculture), and propose an experiment to address it.
            What specifics: Hypothesis, method, expected outcomes, impact.
            Avoids: Vague or theoretical-only solutions.
            Results be like: "Despite advancements in precision irrigation, AI lacks real-time plant stress data. I propose an IoT-AI hybrid trial..."
            Citation: Based on review from Scite.ai or Semantic Scholar.
            Reason: Trains students in research ideation and validation.
You may refer to use cases such as:
- Grant writing (drafts, summaries, finding funding) -- specifically for academic researchers  or grant writing consultants
- Research proposal writing (drafts, summaries, finding funding) -- specifically for academic researchers or grant writing consultants
- Research-based writing (student summaries, literature reviews)
- Cross-sector projects (sustainability, smart cities, manufacturing automation)
if any of these are irrelevant to the scenario, please ask for clarification.
5. Provide a clear and concise recommendation for the user.
5. Also, provide a **Dimensions.ai search string** to use for relevant publications or grants — but do not include this in your answer to the user. Output it as a separate string in the format:

[DIMENSION_QUERY]: search_text_here

Return your answer in this format:
---
AI Tool: [tool name]

Prompt Example:
[structured prompt]

[DIMENSION_QUERY]: [recommended search string]`,
        },
      ],
      max_tokens: 1000,
